## **Summary**

VGReviews is a video game review website that allows any user to generate game review content and 
also edit and delete their published reviews.

### **Introduction**

If your looking for your next game to play or enjoy writing about your gaming journey. This is the 
app for you. 

Users can register an account, browse games and reviews, add your own and edit your 
content.

At VGReviews we don't make a qucik judgement of a game based on a review score. You might be 
missing out on a good game. That's why we encourage our writers to be as honest and thorough as
possible to bring you the best reviews possible.

As gamers like yourself we know review score for a single game can be found anywhere within the 
scale of 1 to 10. Content is king and we feel it's no different when it comes to game reviews. 
The content you read will help you to make the best decisions.

## **UX (User Experience)**

- Does this fit my user's needs?
- Does the user like my website?
- Does the user like being at my website?
- Is this a website a user might want to return to in the future?

These are all questions I asked myself throughout the UX design process.

### **Design Choices**

#### Colour Scheme

![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000`
![#1d800a](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1d800a/000000?text=+) `#1d800a`
![#39ff14](https://via.placeholder.com/15/39ff14/000000?text=+) `#39ff14`
![#9cff8a](https://via.placeholder.com/15/9cff8a/000000?text=+) `#9cff8a`
![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff`
![#404040](https://via.placeholder.com/15/404040/000000?text=+) `#404040`
![#808080](https://via.placeholder.com/15/808080/000000?text=+) `#808080`
![#c0c0c0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c0c0c0/000000?text=+) `#c0c0c0`

- Black and white are the dominant/primary colours throughout the website, mainly for nav bars, backgrounds and text. 
- Shades of green are the contrasting accent colours, used in the logo, some headings, icons, borders and buttons.
- The last colours are the contrasting neutrals to use where necessary.

#### Typography

- 'Press Start 2P' is the font I have chosen to use for headings and is part of the logo.
- 'Play' is the font I have chosen to use for all other text.
- These fonts are imported via the head element of an HTML file from Google Fonts.
- Cursive and sans-serif are the fallback fonts if for some reason the above fonts can't be imported into the site 
  correctly.
- Like the names suggest, they are both very appropriate to use for a gaming website, are generally very popular 
  in the developer world and are also very easy to read and attractive.

#### Icons/Imagery

- Font Awesome was used to import icons into the website.
- The background images I chose for this website fit the gaming theme perfectly.
- In conclusion, I feel all the icons and imagery in combination with the colour scheme and typography produce a 
  modern and attractive looking design.

### **Strategy**

The focus of this project is on using the knowledge I have learned of Python to build a responsive application, in 
this case, a game review website to demonstrate to anyone my capabilities in Python alongside HTML5 and CSS3, and 
jQuery.

### **Scope**

My website's main target users are both casual and passionate gamers. The scope of this app is to provide a place 
where any gamer, with any platform or console preference can share their honest opinions on the games they have 
played, or read those other users like themselves have posted.

My app caters to the basic needs of an administrator by including an variety of tools in order to moderate user 
posted content and provide updates to the website with more gaming platforms, genres or games.

My project provides every user tier 'CRUD' 'CRUD' (Create Read Update Delete) functionality on any of their own 
data added to the wesbite, with tools to search, sort and make any edits.

I bucket my features into separate lists by priority:

1. 'Will Do' features had to be completed by my given submission deadline for this project. These have one or both of
   the following characteristics:
   _ Upper bound: Meet the requirements of a project based on the project specifications.
   _ Lower bound: Show as much prowess in course material as possible. Show that I can use the different facets of
   each language (HTML/CSS/JS/Python).
2. 'Stretch Goals' are features to try to implement if I had time left at the end of the project. These should be
   relatively quick and easy to implement but only if the above features have been completed.
3. 'Won't Do' features are features I won't get done before the project deadline but are features I may want to work
   on in the future and include in future updates.

### **Structure**

I knew I had to limit what functions and mechanics I wanted to include if I was to finish this project by the final
submission deadline. WEBSITE LAYOUT/PAGE DESCRIPTIONS HERE

#### **Wireframes**

Listed below are the mobile, tablet and desktop wireframes for my website, created using the Balsamiq Wireframes
application. These wireframes were produced to show the planned differences in appearance between large and small
screen sizes, but please note that they do not reflect a 100% replicated result of my website and were only used
as an original concept design to get the layout of each part or a particular feature of my website started.

## **Information Architecture**

### **Chosen Database**

I chose the NoSQL database, MongoDB for this particular project.

### **Database Schema**

<img src="static/images/readme/vgreviews_db_schema.png" style="margin: 0;">

#### Collections

As you can see above, the VGReviews database on MongoDB features 5 inter-related collections:

> **Note**: All collections contain the "_id" key with an autogenerated ObjectId string value.

    * The genres collection - contains the key "genre" (genre name) with a string value.

    * The platforms collection - contains the keys "platform" (platform name) and "img_url" with string values.

    * The games collection - contains the keys "title" (game name), "img_url", "description", "genre", "developer" 
      (game developer name), "platform", "year" (year of game release on platform), and "added_by" (added by user) 
      all with string values.

    * The reviews collection - contains the keys "title" (game name), "platform", "review" (user generated review 
      text), and "completed" (Does the user feel they have completed the game?) all with string values.

    * The users collection - contains the key "username" with a string value and the key "password" with a string 
      value that has been hashed and salted by Werkzeug.
