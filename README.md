## **Summary**

VGReviews is a video game review website that allows any user to generate game review content and 
also edit and delete their published reviews.

### **Introduction**

If your looking for your next game to play or enjoy writing about your gaming journey. This is the 
app for you. 

Users can register an account, browse games and reviews, add your own and edit your 
content.

At VGReviews we don't make a qucik judgement of a game based on a review score. You might be 
missing out on a good game. That's why we encourage our writers to be as honest and thorough as
possible to bring you the best reviews possible.

As gamers like yourself we know review score for a single game can be found anywhere within the 
scale of 1 to 10. Content is king and we feel it's no different when it comes to game reviews. 
The content you read will help you to make the best decisions.

### **Design Choices**

#### Colour Scheme

![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000`
![#1d800a](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1d800a/000000?text=+) `#1d800a`
![#39ff14](https://via.placeholder.com/15/39ff14/000000?text=+) `#39ff14`
![#9cff8a](https://via.placeholder.com/15/9cff8a/000000?text=+) `#9cff8a`
![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff`
![#404040](https://via.placeholder.com/15/404040/000000?text=+) `#404040`
![#808080](https://via.placeholder.com/15/808080/000000?text=+) `#808080`
![#c0c0c0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c0c0c0/000000?text=+) `#c0c0c0`

- Black and white are the dominant/primary colours throughout the website, mainly for nav bars, backgrounds and text. 
- Shades of green are the contrasting accent colours, used in the logo, some headings, icons, borders and buttons.
- The last colours are the contrasting neutrals to use where necessary.

#### Typography

- 'Press Start 2P' is the font I have chosen to use for headings and is part of the logo.
- 'Play' is the font I have chosen to use for all other text.
- These fonts are imported via the head element of an HTML file from Google Fonts.
- Cursive and sans-serif are the fallback fonts if for some reason the above fonts can't be imported into the site correctly.
- Like the names suggest, they are both very appropriate to use for a gaming website, are generally very popular in the developer 
  world and are also very easy to read and attractive.

#### Icons/Imagery

- Font Awesome was used to import icons into the website.
- The background images I chose for this website fit the gaming theme perfectly.
- In conclusion, I feel all the icons and imagery in combination with the colour scheme and typography produce a modern and
  attractive looking design.
