## **Summary**

VGReviews is a video game review website that allows any user to generate game review content and 
also edit and delete their published reviews.

### **Introduction**

If your looking for your next game to play or enjoy writing about your gaming journey. This is the 
app for you. 

Users can register an account, browse games and reviews, add your own and edit your 
content.

At VGReviews we don't make a qucik judgement of a game based on a review score. You might be 
missing out on a good game. That's why we encourage our writers to be as honest and thorough as
possible to bring you the best reviews possible.

As gamers like yourself we know review score for a single game can be found anywhere within the 
scale of 1 to 10. Content is king and we feel it's no different when it comes to game reviews. 
The content you read will help you to make the best decisions.
